After the 5G launch, Lucknow  is facing highest Unsubscribe user which is 77.91%.
* Unsubscribe user of all  the city has increased after the 5G launch  except Mumbai.
* After the 5G launch, only plan P1 is performing well in terms of revenue and Plans( p11, p12 and p13) are launched, after the 5G launch they are also doing good in terms of revenue form June to September.
* Plans p2 and p3 have slightly decreased  their revenue, after the 5G launch.
* Plans ( p4, p5, p6 and p7) are not performing well, after the 5G launch
* Plans (p8, P9 and P10) are affected largely by the 5G launch, we should discontinue these plans.
* After the 5G launch, telecom companies started providing free internet services and  since these three plans are basically limited validities for 1 or, 3 days thatâ€™s why the plans (p8, p9 and p10) have stopped  generating revenue so, I think, we  should discontinue these  plans.
